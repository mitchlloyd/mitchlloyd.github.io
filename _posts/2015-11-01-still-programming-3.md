"Coding" is Confusing People
----------------------------

The habit of calling programming "coding" can mislead people into thinking that
programmers are translating one set of instructions to another.

For contrast let's look a look at medical coding. A patient visits the emergency
room and a doctor says their thumb has been cut off. That's ID9 code
885. Another patient arrives needing treatment for recurring depression. That's
296\.3. In this sense, people are assigning a concept in the real world (the
doctor's depression diagnosis) to something that helps classify and
organize data.

Let's also consider secret secret military codes or a code for particular
mediums like Morse code. The goal here is to start with a message, "hello", code
that word, and then get "hello" on the other end of the transmission.

It is easy to mistake programming for coding activities like these.  If
someone came to me with a Java Program and said, I want a line-by-line replica
of this program written in Ruby, I suppose that would be similar to this type of
translation work but this is also something that a programmer would not
generally do.

A developer does not use a series of pictures from a designer to "code" a user
interface nor does a programmer take a list of requirements written in English
and "code" them into Java. There is no deterministic mapping between problems
and solutions and, as observed by the "agile" coding movement, a successful
software product is unlikely to adhere to all the planned requirements.
Pictures aren't programs and neither are pages of requirements. These artifacts
are representations of ideas from the designer and from the business analyst
that need to be understood to create a new set of ideas that produce a running
program.

In Mores code, the word "Hello" and `.... . .-..  .-.. ---` are equivalent. If the
doctor says that your thumb was cut off, the medical coder should always code
that as 855. Any variance in these situations is a mistake.  Programmers do not
code requirements into an application any more than a biographer codes someone's
life into a book.

The Ethos of the Argument
-------------------------

I've challenged the premise that the demand for programming (or "coding") will
decrease due to new user interfaces or advances in computing. Programming has
steadily become more efficient and approachable since it had a name and the
demand for the work has not decreased. As we make programming easier, the
incidental complexity of technology fades away, but the inherent complexity in
the world's problems stays constant. Because of this, we are likely to see
diminishing returns as we continue to improve the state of programming.

As much as I disagree with the reasons that I've seen predicting the demise of
programming, I do understand the ethos of the arguments: something _feels_ out
of balance. It seems strange that a worker could double their salary by learning
a skill that can be taught in few of months. It feels like we've paid
programmers to create a login forms and shopping cart checkouts too many times.

It's hard to talk about programming without discussing the venture capital
investments that have helped fuel its growth in the past decade. The dream that
the next Facebook will spontaneously generate out of some socially-awkward,
20-year-old in a hoodie captured the imagination of investors and worked its way
into our popular culture. When you walk into many tech startups or even
established Silicon Valley companies, you'll be greeted with arcade games, ping
pong tables, and kegs of beer. Partially, this decor serves as a signal to
differentiate a startup from the corporations they plan to disrupt, but it also
plays to stereotypes -- like a makeshift habitat a child might build for
caterpillar, hoping to see it metamorphosize under their supervision.

When I meet budding entrepreneurs I it can be hard to tell if they actually want
a tech business or really want to _talk_ about having a tech business.
Straightforward questions like, "What was your annual revenue last year and how
many customers do you have?" yield indecipherable answers like, "we're
consistently seeing 5 points month-over-month with 12% uplift".

Building these environments and affecting investor jargon are superstitious
responses to the black box of software creation.

How can the same product cost $10,000, $10,000,000, or be impossible to build
based on factors that management isn't even aware of? There is a saying that
software projects don't fail for technical reasons but in practice it's often
impossible for management see the technical issues that contribute to their
failure. Looking back on a project the costs seems inevitable, but they were
not.

* An employee decides to try an emerging database technology they read about on
  Hacker News. Three years later the company has a team migrating to a
  more proven solution while others keep the lights on.

* An enthusiastic group of programmers believe they can reinvent infrastructure
  while simultaneously building a product. Management asked for an online store
  but got a failed JavaScript framework instead.

* A project has stagnated for years without new features while competitors
  whittle at the company's market share. Millions are poured into development
  and UX and there isn't an automated test in sight.

Building the right thing is the most important part of a software project but,
like a collage freshman declaring a major, companies need a chance to learn and
change direction. The difference between a product that can adapt in a few
months and one that takes years to rewrite will make or break a company.

Despite the issues I see in software development, I've very optimistic about its
future. The industry eventually gets over fads like, "make an iPad app for
everything", or "social network for _x_". I used to hear from startup incubators
that everything was about having a "Big Idea" and now the [messaging emphasizes
the importance of having a great
team](https://www.ycombinator.com/apply/#whowefund). More often I see leaders in
companies that value open source projects and understand the tradeoffs their workers make
in development because they've worked on software projects first-hand in many
different capacities. The black box is becoming transparent.

Although you won't need to look far for nay-sayers, I believe we can build
software better and faster today than ever before. As a web programmer, knowing
every browser quirk has become less important and knowing the customer's
business has become more important. It's all about more signal, less noise.

To anyone exploring options for a first career or the next: if you thrive on
communication, problem solving, and craft then I think you'll love programming.
