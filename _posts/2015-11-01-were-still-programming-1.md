When I was a junior in high-school, adults asked me what I wanted to do for a
living. I spent my free time making music and programming computer game but my
parents were not satisfied with either of these activities as career
aspirations.

Programming, according to the wisdom of 1998, would soon to be outsourced to
countries with emerging economies like India, China and Russia.  Programing was
was a poor choice of profession for someone living in the United States, I was
told.

"It really is very mundane," a teacher told me. "You could be someone that
_manages_ developers, but you don't want to actually be writing code."

In this series of posts I'll describe the nature of computer programming to
people that may have only a passing interest in it.  I want to explain to why
programming will not be cheaply outsourced, automated away, or suddenly become
obsolete.

Programming in Plain English
----------------------------

Throughout the short history of programming people have tried to eliminate
programming by eliminating the esoteric code used for programming. Instead of
programming in Java, C++, Fortran, or Python why don't we program in English?

Programming languages are not intended to obscure what programmers are doing,
they are earnest attempts let humans express solutions as clearly and simply as
possible.  If programmers could program effectively in in their spoken languages
they would, but unfortunately, spoken language is to verbose and ambiguous to
effectively describe technical problems.

Here is a programming expression in COBOL, a language designed to read like English:

```
X IS GREATER THAN Y
```

That seems fine. Here is that expression in Ruby, C, Java, Python, and many
other languages. This is also a valid expression in COBOL:

```
x > y
```

You probably already understand that code because you likely have some
experience with math notation. Mathematicians also uses symbolic language to
express problems and solutions.

Here is a simple math problem expressed in English.

```
Take one and two and add them together. Now take ten and subtract eight from it.
Take the first result from adding one and two and multiply it by the second
result that you got from subtracting ten from eight.
```

Now here is that same problem in many programming languages:

```
(1 + 2) * (10 - 8)
```

Hopefully you can see that even simple problems can be awkward to express in
English.  Imagine needing to reach a page of text to understand something that a
programmer could quickly understand by reading just a few lines of code.
Programming languages are better suited to solving problems with logic and data
than English. This is why they exist.


Programming With Visual Tools
-----------------------------

Another argument for the demise of programming is that an easy-to-use visual
tool will make the job simple enough for everyone to do, eliminating programming
as a profession.

Modern programmers already use many visual tools as they program. They have
tests that show them alerts when something is wrong.  They have text editors
that complete code for them and have sophisticated ways of showing errors as
they type. There are tools like Xcode and Visual Studio Code that have drag and
drop interfaces.  There are tools that graph code changes to an evolving
programming project.  Look at a programmer's screen as they work and you'll see
a myriad of colors, signals, shapes, and diagrams giving them information.

Programming is not challenging because of archaic tools. Rather, programming
tools have some of the most sophisticated interfaces that you'll find.  User
interfaces that primarily rely on a mouse or finger for input can be easier to
use because the input that a user can provide at any time is very constrained.
In other words if you see a box that says "Save or Delete?" with two buttons,
you know exactly what you can do.  When programming there are no practical
limits on what the developer is allowed to do at any given moment. Email users
could write messages by scrolling through a list of possible words and choosing
them one at a time, but it's well worth their time to learn to type instead.

We _have_ created programming interfaces for casual users -- most notably
spreadsheet programs like Excel. With just a little training, a user can
process large amounts of data in interesting ways and even create their own
user interfaces.

Excel is excellent at processing data in ad hoc ways. A single spreadsheet user
can perform the work of a thousand or more that lack the same tools. However,
to continue to tackle bigger problem users will spend years learning learning
to use pivot tables, formulas, and eventually the Basic programming language.

The means by which programmers input their ideas into a computer is completely
incidental to the task of programming. Most programmers type and use mouses. A
programmer with hand disabilities may use their feet to augment their input.
We have programs that can translate voice into text. No form of input is any more or less indicative of programming.

If you want some thoughtful discussion about the futures of human-computer
interaction for programmers I suggest you read and watch the work of [Bret
Victor](worrydream.com). Specifically [Seeing
Spaces](http://worrydream.com/SeeingSpaces/) is relevant to this discussion.
But no matter what medium we use to build programs, it is the ideas and logic
that we describe with that medium that have value.

Typing words into a computer is as incidental to programming as talking on the
phone is for a CEO. It does not define the job they perform.
